# ðŸ“Š Interactive web applications using the R programming language

This project is a web application developed using the Shiny framework in R. It allows users to visualize and analyze data in an intuitive and dynamic way.

With this application, you can:

- Explore and filter data in real time
- Create custom charts and tables
- Use advanced data visualization features
- Export the results in different formats

Here is an example of a scatter plot with regression lines generated by the application:
